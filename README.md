LSTM Stock Price Prediction (with Live Market Data)

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning models to predict stock prices using historical data fetched in real-time from Yahoo Finance.
It also includes a future trend forecaster that predicts whether the stock is likely to rise , fall , or remain stable.

Features
  1. Live Market Data Fetching
    Fetch the latest stock data using the yfinance API:
    Supports any stock ticker (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, etc.)
    Custom time periods (1y, 2y, 5y, max)
    Custom intervals (1d, 1h, 30m, 5m)

  2. LSTM Deep Learning Model
    60-day sequence training window
    Data normalization with MinMaxScaler
    Model saving and reloading support
    Predicts future stock values
  
  3. Future Trend Detection
    Predicts N future days and classifies the trend as:
    Likely to Rise
    Likely to Fall
    Likely to Stay Stable
  
  4. Visualizations
    Actual vs. Predicted price chart
    Highlight of highest predicted price
    Training vs. Testing data visualization

How to Run
Requirements

  Install all dependencies:
    pip install yfinance tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    
  RUN THE CODE
    Open the notebook in Google Colab.
    Enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, AMZN, MSFT).
    Enter a data period (e.g., 1y, 2y, 5y, max).
    Enter an interval (e.g., 1d, 1h, 30m, 5m).

  The notebook will:
    Fetch data
    Train the LSTM
    Predict stock prices
    Predict the future trend
    Plot actual vs. predicted prices
    
   Example Outputs
     Trend Output

  Graph Outputs
    Actual prices (black)
    Predicted prices (green)
    Highest predicted point highlighted
    

Data Source
This project uses live market data fetched through the yfinance Python package:
